# Algorithms-for-Optimization-Problem
This file is summary of algorithms for "optimization problems".

## What you Need
- Compiler for C-programming-language
- TextEditor
- A little knowladge of C-programming-language (you have to make some function)

## How to Use
1. Download some Target Folder from this page
2. Open main.c
3. Edit "objective function" etc...
4. (Option)Edit other files
5. Compile all Files together

## Gradient Method Folder
This method needs "Objective-Function" and "Gradient-Function".
- (Simplest) Gradient method
- Momentum Method
- Nesterov's Accelerate Gradient Method
- Proximal Gradient Method
- FISTA (only Differentiable Function)
- FISTA with Restart method (only Diffentiable Function)
